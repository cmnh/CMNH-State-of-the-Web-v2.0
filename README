State of the Web v2.0 Report

This is the HTML version of the State of the Web report that is published monthly internally by Carnegie Museum of Natural History.
The data comes from Google Analytics and HootSuite/Pinterest.
It uses HTML/Javascript/JQuery for the front end and PHP for the back-end
It uses Google-hosted JQuery and it requires the following libraries:

Google Analytics Add-on:
https://github.com/CMP-DigitalEngagement/Google-Analytics-Add-on

Highcharts (including data module):

Font Awesome (just for the up/down arrows. I know, it seems like overkill. Font Awesome is awesome, though. You should try it.):
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/



INSTALLATION:

Follow the instructions to installing the Google Analytics Add-on
The following files will need to be customized for your particular data feeds (instructions are in each file):

/analytics_json/ga_accounts.php
/analyitcs_json/sotw_socialmedia_json.php
/js/sotw_analytics_v2.js



TO DO:

Currently, it processes the previous month based upon the current month. Most of the logic to process an arbitrary month is in place, it just needs to be all connected with a UI.
It currently supports 3 secondary web properties. More than 3 secondary web properties won't print properly formatted.


Version 2.2

Added support for Tumblr, new icons
